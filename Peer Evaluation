## Group exercise

4 People / group


## Objectives

- Learn to work in group
- Learn to complete a project so it can be delivered to a client

## Instructions 

- Invent a company together and think of four pages that the company needs.
- Divide those pages amongst the group and each design one page.
- Once you are all finished, join those pages together into one page (page below page)
- Publish the result with a github repository (call it `name-of-your-business`)
- Make sure everyone in the group has a repository of the website
- Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there
- Add a parallax image header [Example](https://demo.athemes.com/themes/?theme=Sydney)
- Add google maps pinned on the location of your company somewhere on the onepager
- Try to make your website responsive (if you haven't already)
- Mention your phone number somewhere on the onepager, if you click it should (try to) call you

## Assessment

You will do some peer evaluation. Every group will evaluate one other group using the checklist below.    
**Your group will also need to add at least one requirement.**

## Adding your own requirement(s)
1. Change this file (directly on github or fork this repo)
2. Add the requirement(s) at the bottom
3. Notify the group on ryver

## What makes a good requirement?
A good requirement for this list is something that people should have been doing already and that we now explicitly write down. It should not be things that would be nice to have, but things that are essential for every self respecing website in <INSERT CURRENT YEAR>.

## Doing the evaluation
1. Create a file in this folder
2. Copy the requirements below into it
3. Tick the right boxes
4. Commit/push the change
