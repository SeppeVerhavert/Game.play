                <p>
                    Follow Lore and Baron on their adventures through time and space.
                    Handle combat through a series of unique mini-games reminiscent of Wario Ware.
                    Change the story through exploration and interaction with the world.
                    A massive series of optional cryptographic puzzles that can be solved as a community.
                    Varying environments with unique pixel art, an inspired soundtrack, and tons of extra socks.
                    That awful feeling when you do something terrible to someone who loves you.
                    More gags than you can shake a stick at. Binder can lend you one of his if you don't bring your own.
