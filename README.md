### Who made this beautiful page?
1. Wietse Gielen
2. Seppe Verhavert
3. Nic Plackle
4. Merel Van Puymbroeck
5. Blood, Sweat and Tears joined the team also!

### Why did we made this?

As our team said:

> We made this too show our fancy skills and knowledge that we learned in this first month with HTML & CSS!<br>
> This is our Final Test.

### What is it? 

For our final test we needed to make a website for a fictional company. There where a lot of requirements we needed to look out for when we where working on this page.
<strong>Some examples:</strong><br>

- [ ] All buttons and links work
- [ ] All elements work and are complete (menu, lists, images, ...)
- [ ] Everything on the page has a function, a reason to be there
- [ ] No dead links
- [ ] English and dutch are not mixed
- [ ] No spelling errors
- [ ] No grammar errors
- [ ] The website is deployed somewhere
- [ ] Everything is relevant (no image of a barber on the website of a baker)

In the end we merged our 4 pages in one smooth page. 

### Okay cool, but what is it doing here on GitHub? 

Because it is a fictional project, we shared it on GitHub instead putting it online. It's a big project for us to let you guys see where we already stand after one month of coding and learning. 

### Proud on this!
